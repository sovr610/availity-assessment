# Availity assessment

## Questions asked on the assessment

1. Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.  It can also be a personal or school project.

  - There are many projects I am currently working on that would take the cake, but are not finished. One project I finished that I 
  am very proud about, is when I had to work on a project called BOSS at cynerge consulting. BOSS is a web application that managed
  the business logic and house keeping for the forester service. We were told to use jQuery and java spring boot for the tech stack,
  note it was just jquery. Long story short, with another developer, we had to create our own Javascript framework mostly by scratch.
  it had a json to html component system that allowed very fast refactors of each page on the web app. The json system also integrated
  event handling, properties of each element and reusability of each json component. Some other features were managing how the javcascript
  files were loaded in the project without any conflictions and done asynchronously for better performance. Loading a page was really
  quick, and the development process after making the framework would quadruple our development speed.

2. Tell me about something you have read recently that you would recommend and why. (Can be a Github Repo, Article, Blog, Book, etc)

  - There is a website I came across not too long ago. It was __FORTRAN In The Browser__, and how to compile fortran to webassembly.
  Now fortran is a language that pre-dates the C programming language. I love to look at vintage languages and learn from them to
  expand my current knowledge on programming languages. APL is another language I like, APL can accomplish a lot with very little code
  compared to today's popular languages. In the articale it uses LFortran,with the combination of tools such as LLVM, Flang-7, F18, AOCC
  and a plugin for gcc called dragonegg. I have not build a wasm module from fortran yet, but have played around with fortran and LLVM
  here and there. (website)[https://chrz.de/2020/04/21/fortran-in-the-browser/]

3. How would you explain to your grandmother what Availity does

  - Availity is a service that helps your provider, also known as your doctor, to get the best healthcare plans for you and to manage easier transactions between you and your provider. 

## code project index

4. Whithin the directory `C-sharp/LispChecker` is where you will find the `LispChecker` .NET project. This project allows you to enter a string within the console
application that represents LISP code. The program will validate if the parentheses are properly closed and nested.

6. Within the directory `C-sharp/insuranceCompanySorter` is where the C# application lays for organizing CSV files by splitting up info on each enrollee based on the insurance company
associated to the account. Additional get rid of duplicate data and pick the enrollee with a higher version number, along with sorted by lastname and firstname. 

**Instructions:** 
 1. to have the program run, you just need to paste the directory of where the CSV files you want organized in the console (user input prompt).
  - note: you can have multiple csv files with info about enrollees, as long as the csv files have the layout `UserId,FirstName LastName, Version, InsuranceCompany` it will work just fine.
 2. A new folder will be produced in the directory of where the csv files are located named `organizedDocuments`. Within the folder will contain csv files based on each insurance companies.

 example: this is using the included text files I generated by the instruction in the assessment.
